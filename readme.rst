The goal of this project is to provide a base for extending and
adapting Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.  The Sphinx_ system is
designed for documenting software, something quite similar to the SRD,
and is well suited to extending reference documents like this one, and
for converting them in to a large number of useful formats.

This document was created from the `Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition
System Reference Document (SRD) v5.1 Remastered in Markdown Format
<https://ogl-srd5.com/>`__ by `B.A. Umberger
<http://www.umbyology.com>`__.  The initial versions were converted
using `Pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>`__, then hand-edited.

The next step is to create a custom domain extension for Sphinx so
that things like classes, spells, creatures, etc. are easy to create
and cross-reference (rather like classes and functions in software).
