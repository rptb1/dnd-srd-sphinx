Backgrounds
===========

Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where
you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the
world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled
soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue
might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a
jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your
character's identity. The most important question to ask about your
background is *what changed*? Why did you stop doing whatever your
background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money
to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy
background, why don't you have *more* money? How did you learn the
skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share
your background?

The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits
(features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.
