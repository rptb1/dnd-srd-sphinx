Falling Net
~~~~~~~~~~~

*Mechanical trap*

This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.

The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two
columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to
spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check
using thieves' tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character
without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using
any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.

When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot
square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and :ref:`restrained`,
and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked
:ref:`prone`. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10

Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a
success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage
to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot square section of it, freeing any
creature trapped in that section.
