Background Traits

Proficiencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described
in :ref:`Using Ability Scores`).

In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or
more tools (detailed in :ref:`Equipment`).

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different
sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind
(skill or tool) instead.

Languages
~~~~~~~~~

Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages
beyond those given by race. See :ref:`Languages`.

Equipment
~~~~~~~~~

Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the
optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting
equipment from your background.

Suggested Characteristics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your
background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them
randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of
your own creation.

Customizing a Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it
better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a
background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any
two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages
from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package
from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment
section. (If you spend coin, you can't also take the equipment package
suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one
ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can't find a feature that matches
your desired background, work with your GM to create one.
