*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the *detect
thoughts* spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain
concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a
telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply-using
a bonus action to do so-while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with *detect thoughts*, you can use an
action to cast the :ref:`suggestion` spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that
creature. Once used, the *suggestion* property can't be used again until
the next dawn.
