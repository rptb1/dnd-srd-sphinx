*Wondrous item, legendary*

This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond
between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has
been coated inside with *oil of slipperiness*. When found, a container
contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes
1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken
only by the application of *universal solvent* or *oil of etherealness*,
or with a :ref:`wish` spell.
