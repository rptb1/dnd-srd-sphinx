*Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can turn invisible as an action. Anything
you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you. You remain invisible
until the ring is removed, until you attack or cast a spell, or until
you use a bonus action to become visible again.
