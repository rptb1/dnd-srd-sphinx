*Potion, uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the
:ref:`enlarge/reduce` spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The
red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to
color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle
fails to interrupt this process.
