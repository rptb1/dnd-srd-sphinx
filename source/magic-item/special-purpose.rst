You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the
exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder's use of the item aligns
with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from
this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and
could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated
properties. You can pick a special purpose or roll on the following
table.
