*Potion, rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the
:ref:`enlarge/reduce` spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The
red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and
then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle
fails to interrupt this process.
