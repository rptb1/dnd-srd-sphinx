*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you
gain the following benefits:

-  The robe lets you see in all directions, and you have advantage on
   Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

-  You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

.. index:: invisible; counteracted by Robe of Eyes

-  You can see :ref:`invisible` creatures and objects, as well as see into the
   Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.

The eyes on the robe can't be closed or averted. Although you can close
or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while
wearing this robe.

.. index:: blinded; by robe of eyes

A :ref:`light` spell cast on the robe or a :ref:`daylight` spell cast within 5
feet of the robe causes you to be :ref:`blinded` for 1 minute. At the end of
each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for
*light* or DC 15 for *daylight*), ending the blindness on a success.
