*Potion, uncommon*

This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it
flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller
creature, along with the equipment it's wearing and carrying (one
additional vial is required for each size category above Medium).
Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the
effect of a :ref:`freedom of movement` spell for 8 hours.

Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where
it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the :ref:`grease` spell
in that area for 8 hours.
