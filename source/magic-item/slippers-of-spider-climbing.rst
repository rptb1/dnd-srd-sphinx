*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across
vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your
hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
However, the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a slippery
surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.
