*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command
word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on
your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action.
The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you
can't use them again for 1d12 hours.

Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might
be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware
thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves
like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and
sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its
wielder or a continual thorn in the side.

Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest
sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never
sentient.

Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM's control. Any
activated property of the item is under the item's control, not its
wielder's. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the
item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the
relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties
or even turn them against the wielder.
