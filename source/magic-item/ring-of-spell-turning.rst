*Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving throws against any
spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if
you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the
spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the
slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the
caster.
