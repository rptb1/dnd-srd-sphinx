*Potion, common*

When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your
walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on
Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated
into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking
the bottle fails to mix the colors.
