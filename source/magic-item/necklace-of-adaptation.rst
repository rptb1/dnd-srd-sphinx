*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any
environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against
harmful gases and vapors (such as *cloudkill* and *stinking cloud*
effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).
