*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While
wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the *charm
person* spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided
that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all
expended charges daily at dawn.
