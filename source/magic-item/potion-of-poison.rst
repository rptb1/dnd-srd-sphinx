*Potion, uncommon*

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a *potion of healing* or
other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by
illusion magic. An :ref:`identify` spell reveals its true nature.

If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a
DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`poisoned`. At the start of each of
your turns while you are :ref:`poisoned` in this way, you take 3d6 poison
damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving
throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your
subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage
decreases to 0.
