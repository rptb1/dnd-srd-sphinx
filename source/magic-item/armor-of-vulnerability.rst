*Armor (plate), rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following
damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the
type or determines it randomly.

:bi:`Curse`. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an
:ref:`identify` spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to
the armor curses you until you are targeted by the :ref:`remove curse` spell
or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While
cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types
associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance).
