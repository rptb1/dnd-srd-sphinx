*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear
to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any
creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take
damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next
turn. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated,
restrained, or otherwise unable to move.
