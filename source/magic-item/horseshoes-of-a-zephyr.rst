*Wondrous item, very rare*

These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are
affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the
creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This
effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable
surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and
ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal
speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering :ref:`exhaustion <exhaustion>` from a
forced march.
