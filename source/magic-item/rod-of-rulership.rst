*Rod, rare (requires attunement)*

You can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each
creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each
target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be :ref:`charmed` by you
for 8 hours. While :ref:`charmed` in this way, the creature regards you as its
trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do
something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be :ref:`charmed` in this
way. The rod can't be used again until the next dawn.
