*Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)*

While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged
weapon attacks.

:bi:`Curse`. This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you
are targeted by the :ref:`remove curse` spell or similar magic. Removing the
shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is
made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to
become the target instead.
