*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

These furred boots are snug and feel quite warm. While you wear them,
you gain the following benefits:

-  You have resistance to cold damage.

-  You ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow.

-  You can tolerate temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit
   without any additional protection. If you wear heavy clothes, you can
   tolerate temperatures as low as -100 degrees Fahrenheit.
