** Welcome to the online Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition System
 Reference Document (SRD) v5.1 Remastered in Markdown Format! **

--------------

**The Systems Reference Document (SRD)** contains guidelines for
publishing content under the Open-Gaming License (OGL). The `Dungeon
Masters Guild <http://dungeonmastersguild.com/>`__ also provides
self-publishing opportunities for individuals and groups. The OGL and
Dungeon Masters Guild offer different kinds of publishing opportunities.
For an overview of the programs, please visit the official `Wizards SRD
page <http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd>`__
to compare the programs.

**Why Markdown format?** Markdown is a lightweight markup language with
plain text formatting syntax created by `John
Gruber <https://daringfireball.net>`__. It is designed so that it can be
converted to HTML and many other formats using any number of various
Markdown editors. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for
writing books, blogs and messages, or to simply create rich text using a
plain text or markkdown editor.

! The documents contained herein are edited from scratch into Markdown
format for import into other formats or into your own 5E projects. This
is not a simple export as you find elsewhere, we have painstakingly
remastered the original Wizard's SRD PDF to markdown
paragraph-by-paragraph and **includes all errata from Nov 2018**. The
original documents can be downloaded from my `Github OGL-SRD
Repository <https://github.com/Umbyology/OGL-SRD5>`__. Please report any
issues you find through our Github account.
