:bi:`Amorphous`. The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1
inch wide without squeezing.

:bi:`Corrosive Form`. A creature that touches the pudding or hits it
with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage.
Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the pudding
corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and
cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the
weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that
hits the pudding is destroyed after dealing damage.

The pudding can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1
round.

:bi:`Spider Climb`. The pudding can climb difficult surfaces, including
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.


Actions
^^^^^^^

:bi:`Pseudopod`. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage.
In addition, nonmagical armor worn by the target is partly dissolved and
takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The
armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.

Reactions
         

:bi:`Split`. When a pudding that is Medium or larger is subjected to
lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two new puddings if it has
at least 10 hit points. Each new pudding has hit points equal to half
the original pudding's, rounded down. New puddings are one size smaller
than the original pudding.

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

:bi:`Ooze Cube`. The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can
enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's
Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw.

Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover.

A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a
creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 12
Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid
damage.

The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or
smaller creatures inside it at a time.

:bi:`Transparent`. Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a
successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a cube that has
neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the cube's
space while unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube.


Actions
^^^^^^^

:bi:`Pseudopod`. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) acid damage.

:bi:`Engulf`. The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can
enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a
creature's space, the creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.

On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back
or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be pushed
suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the creature
takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't
breathe, is :ref:`restrained`, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of
each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature
moves with it.

An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC
12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space
of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.
