Actions
^^^^^^^

:bi:`Multiattack`. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

:bi:`Bite`. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

:bi:`Claw`. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.

:bi:`Tail`. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

:bi:`Frightful Presence`. Each creature of the dragon's choice that is
within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16
Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is
successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the
dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

:bi:`Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6)`. The dragon exhales poisonous gas in
a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18
Constitution saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) poison damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


Legendary Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect**. The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack**. The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)**. The dragon beats its wings. Each
creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity
saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked
prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
