**Petrifying Gaze**. If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the
basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force
the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk
isn't :ref:`incapacitated`. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to
turn to stone and is :ref:`restrained`. It must repeat the saving throw at the
end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the
creature is :ref:`petrified` until freed by the *greater restoration* spell or
other magic.

A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving
throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk
until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If
it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the
save.

If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright
light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.
