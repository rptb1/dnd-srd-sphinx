structures.


Actions
^^^^^^^

:bi:`Multiattack`. The kraken makes three tentacle attacks, each of
which it can replace with one use of Fling.

.. index:: blinded; by kraken bite
   single: grappled; by kraken bite
   single: restrained; by kraken bite

:bi:`Bite`. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 23 (3d8 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or
smaller creature :ref:`grappled` by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and
the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is :ref:`blinded` and
:ref:`restrained`, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside
the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of
the kraken's turns.

If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature
inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw
at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which
fall :ref:`prone` in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies,
a swallowed creature is no longer :ref:`restrained` by it and can escape from
the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting :ref:`prone`.

:bi:`Tentacle`. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 30 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is
:ref:`grappled` (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is
:ref:`restrained`. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one
target.

.. index:: prone; by kraken fling

:bi:`Fling`. One Large or smaller object held or creature :ref:`grappled` by
the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked
:ref:`prone`. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3
(1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target
is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18
Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked :ref:`prone`.

:bi:`Lightning Storm`. The kraken magically creates three bolts of
lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within
120 feet of it. A target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.


Legendary Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The kraken can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The kraken regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Tentacle Attack or Fling**. The kraken makes one tentacle attack or
uses its Fling.

**Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions)**. The kraken uses Lightning Storm.

**Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions)**. While underwater, the kraken expels an
ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and
that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken. Each
creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on
a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong
current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of
the kraken's next turn.
