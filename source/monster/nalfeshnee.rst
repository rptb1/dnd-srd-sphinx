:bi:`Horror Nimbus (Recharge 5-6)`. The nalfeshnee magically emits
scintillating, multicolored light. Each creature within 15 feet of the
nalfeshnee that can see the light must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving
throw or be :ref:`frightened` for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends
for it, the creature is immune to the nalfeshnee's Horror Nimbus for the
next 24 hours.

:bi:`Teleport`. The nalfeshnee magically teleports, along with any
equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied
space it can see.
