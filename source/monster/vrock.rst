Actions
^^^^^^^

:bi:`Multiattack`. The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and
one with its talons.

:bi:`Beak`. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.

:bi:`Talons`. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage.

.. index:: poisoned; by vrock spores

:bi:`Spores (Recharge 6)`. A 15-foot radius cloud of toxic spores
extends out from the vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each
creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw
or become :ref:`poisoned`. While :ref:`poisoned` in this way, a target takes 5 (1d10)
poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also
ends the effect on it.

:bi:`Stunning Screech (1/Day)`. The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each
creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon
must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`stunned` until
the end of the vrock's next turn.
