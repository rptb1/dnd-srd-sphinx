**Speed** 30 ft., fly 90 ft.

+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| STR       | DEX       | CON       | INT       | WIS       | CHA       |
+===========+===========+===========+===========+===========+===========+
| 21 (+5)   | 15 (+2)   | 22 (+6)   | 15 (+2)   | 16 (+3)   | 20 (+5)   |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+

**Saving Throws** Dex +6, Wis +7, Cha +9

**Damage Immunities** lightning, thunder

**Senses** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 13

**Languages** Auran

**Challenge** 11 (7,200 XP)

:bi:`Elemental Demise`. If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into
a warm breeze, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or
carrying.

:bi:`Innate Spellcasting`. The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can
innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: *detect evil and good, detect magic, thunderwave*

3/day each: *create food and water (can create wine instead of water),
tongues, wind walk*

1/day each: *conjure elemental (air elemental only), creation, gaseous
form, invisibility, major image, plane shift*


Actions
^^^^^^^

:bi:`Multiattack`. The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.

:bi:`Scimitar`. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or
thunder damage (djinni's choice).

:bi:`Create Whirlwind`. A 5-foot radius, 30-foot tall cylinder of
swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120
feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains
concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the
djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving
throw or be :ref:`restrained` by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60
feet as an action, and creatures :ref:`restrained` by the whirlwind move with
it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

A creature can use its action to free a creature :ref:`restrained` by the
whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If
the check succeeds, the creature is no longer :ref:`restrained` and moves to
the nearest space outside the whirlwind.
