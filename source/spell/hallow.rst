Hallow
------

*5th-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 24 hours

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000
gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy)
power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if
the radius includes an area already under the effect a *hallow* spell.
The affected area is subject to the following effects.

.. index:: frightened; cured by hallow spell
   single: charmed; cured by hallow spell

First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can't enter the
area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures
within it. Any creature :ref:`charmed`, :ref:`frightened`, or possessed by such a
creature is no longer :ref:`charmed`, :ref:`frightened`, or possessed upon entering
the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of creatures from
this effect.

Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from
the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these
effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the
effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity
or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When
a creature that would be affected enters the spell's area for the first
time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving
throw. On a success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it
leaves the area.

.. index:: frightened; immunity by hallow spell

:bi:`Courage`. Affected creatures can't be :ref:`frightened` while in the area.

:bi:`Darkness`. Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as
magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used
to cast this spell, can't illuminate the area.

:bi:`Daylight`. Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created by
spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell can't
extinguish the light.

:bi:`Energy Protection`. Affected creatures in the area have resistance
to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or
slashing.

:bi:`Energy Vulnerability`. Affected creatures in the area have
vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing.

:bi:`Everlasting Rest`. Dead bodies interred in the area can't be turned

travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.
