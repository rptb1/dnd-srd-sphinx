Sentient Magic Items
====================

Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might
be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware
thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves
like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and
sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its
wielder or a continual thorn in the side.

Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest
sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never
sentient.

Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM's control. Any
activated property of the item is under the item's control, not its
wielder's. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the
item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the
relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties
or even turn them against the wielder.


Creating Sentient Magic Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item's
persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions
described here.


Abilities
~~~~~~~~~

A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You
can choose the item's abilities or determine them randomly. To determine
them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and
totaling the rest.


Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its
emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud.
You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table.

+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  d100  | Communication                                                        |
+========+======================================================================+
| 01-60  | The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature        |
|        | carrying or wielding it.                                             |
+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 61-90  | The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages.      |
+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 91-100 | The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. In   |
|        | addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any character |
|        | that carries or wields it.                                           |
+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+


Senses
~~~~~~

With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its
surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll
on the following table.

+----+----------------------------------------------+
| d4 | Senses                                       |
+====+==============================================+
| 1  | Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet.    |
+----+----------------------------------------------+
| 2  | Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet     |
+----+----------------------------------------------+
| 3  | Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet.   |
+----+----------------------------------------------+
| 4  | Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.      |
+----+----------------------------------------------+


Special Purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the
exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder's use of the item aligns
with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from
this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and
could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated
properties. You can pick a special purpose or roll on the following
table.

+-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| d10 | Purpose                                                              |
+=====+======================================================================+
| 1   | :bi:`Aligned:` The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a        |
|     | diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is never neutral.)    |
+-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2   | :bi:`Bane:` The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of a       |
|     | particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls, or wizards.  |
+-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3   | :bi:`Protector:` The item seeks to defend a particular race or kind  |
|     | of creature, such as elves or druids.                                |
+-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4   | :bi:`Crusader:` The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or destroy the     |
|     | servants of a particular deity.                                      |
+-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5   | :bi:`Templar:` The item seeks to defend the servants and interests   |
|     | of a particular deity.                                               |
+-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 6   | :bi:`Destroyer:` The item craves destruction and goads its user to   |
|     | fight arbitrarily.                                                   |
+-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7   | :bi:`Glory Seeker:` The item seeks renown as the greatest magic item |
|     | in the world, by establishing its user as a famous or notorious      |
|     | figure.                                                              |
+-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 8   | :bi:`Lore Seeker:` The item craves knowledge or is determined to     |
|     | solve a mystery, learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy.      |
+-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 9   | :bi:`Destiny Seeker:` The item is convinced that it and its wielder  |
|     | have key roles to play in future events.                             |
+-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 10  | :bi:`Creator Seeker:` The item seeks its creator and wants to        |
|     | understand why it was created.                                       |
+-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------+


Conflict
~~~~~~~~

A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and
alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item's
alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs,
the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's Charisma
check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the
following demands:

-  The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.

-  The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds
   repugnant.

-  The item demands that its wielder pursue the item's goals to the
   exclusion of all other goals.

-  The item demands to be given to someone else. If its wielder refuses
   to comply with the item's wishes, the item can do any or all of the
   following:

-  Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.

-  Suppress one or more of its activated properties.

-  Attempt to take control of its wielder.

If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder
must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's
Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item
for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item's
commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw,
ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user
succeeds or fails, the item can't use this power again until the next
dawn.


Artifacts

Orb of Dragonkind

*Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons.
When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked
their greatest magic, forging five *Orbs of Dragonkind* (or *Dragon
Orbs*) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the
five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a
victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then
destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.

As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or
faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic
has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their
primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some
measure of control over dragons.

Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents
any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality
might find themselves enslaved to an orb.

An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When
used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside
it.

While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's
depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma
check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you
remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb
for as long as you remain attuned to it.

While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your
attunement to it, and the orb casts *suggestion* on you at will (save DC
18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon
essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a
particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the
world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM
decides.

:bi:`Random Properties`. An *Orb of Dragonkind* has the following random
properties:

-  2 minor beneficial properties

-  1 minor detrimental property

-  1 major detrimental property

:bi:`Spells`. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges
daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend
1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from
it: *cure wounds* (5th-level version, 3 charges), *daylight* (1 charge),
*death ward* (2 charges), or *scrying* (3 charges).

You can also use an action to cast the *detect magic* spell from the orb
without using any charges.

:bi:`Call Dragons`. While you control the orb, you can use an action to
cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all
directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to
the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities
such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb
might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once
you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.

:bi:`Destroying an Orb`. An *Orb of Dragonkind* appears fragile but is
impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of
dragons. A *disintegrate* spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon
is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.
