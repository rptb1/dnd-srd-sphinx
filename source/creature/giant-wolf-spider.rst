:bi:`Spider Climb`. The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

:bi:`Web Sense`. While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact
location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

:bi:`Web Walker`. The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by
webbing.


Actions
^^^^^^^

:bi:`Bite`. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11
Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage
reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but :ref:`poisoned`
for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is :ref:`paralyzed` while
:ref:`poisoned` in this way.

Smaller than a giant spider, a **giant wolf spider** hunts prey across
open ground or hides in a burrow or crevice, or in a hidden cavity
beneath debris.
