:bi:`Two-Headed`. The dog has advantage on :ref:`Wisdom (Perception) <perception>` checks
and on saving throws against being :ref:`blinded`, :ref:`charmed`, :ref:`deafened`,
:ref:`frightened`, :ref:`stunned`, or knocked :ref:`unconscious`.


Actions
^^^^^^^

:bi:`Multiattack`. The dog makes two bite attacks.

:bi:`Bite`. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must
succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against disease or become
:ref:`poisoned` until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the
creature must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by
5 (1d10) on a failure. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured.
The creature dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

A **death dog** is an ugly two-headed hound that roams plains, and
deserts. Hate burns in a death dog's heart, and a taste for humanoid
flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers. Death dog saliva
carries a foul disease that causes a victim's flesh to slowly rot off
the bone.
